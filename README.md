I have created this map in Leaflet.js as a part of the #MonthlyMapChallenge #MonthlyMapChallenge1223
The theme of the month: Santa's Stolen Sleigh from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/code/nigelcarpenter/santa-exploration

The map shows Santa's gift points in Scotland. I have also created some silly gift markers with HO!HO! HO popups.
In the spirit of holidays, this is definitely my silliest map so far.
